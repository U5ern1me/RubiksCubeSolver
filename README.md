## Rubik's Cube Solver
This project solves a randomly shuffled 3x3 Rubik's Cube, outputting the required moves to solve the cube optimally.
## Features
- Models the Cube in 3 different representations, using standard data structures present in C++
- Executes 3 different standard algorithms (BFS, DFS and IDDFS) to achieve a solve time of under 3 seconds for an 8-move jumbled cube
- Implements Korf's IDA* Algorithm, which solves the cube most optimally, achieving a solve time of under 10 seconds for a 13-move jumbled cube
